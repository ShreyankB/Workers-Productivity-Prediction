# Workers-Productivity-Prediction
## Problem
The dataset garments-worker-productivity.csv contains required data as features to predict productivity of the workers in the factory. Few of the features, which are not self-explanatory, that are used to predict the actual productivity are listed below: 
  > smv: Standard Minute Value, allocated time for the task.
  > 
  > wip: Work in Progress, the number of unfinished items for products.
  >  
  > idle men: The number of workers who were idle due to production interruption. 

*Report attached in the repo contains information about approach taken to predict workers predictivity.*
